This package contains a python classes for performing QC analysis on genotype data. The classes can be used to either perform QC on the individual level, on the SNP/marker level, or both.
The module implements PLINK (v1.9) commands, and uses Matplotlib to generate a QC report as a pdf file.
The class methods use common default thresholds for the QC analysis and was inspired by Marees et al., 2018 (Int J Methods Psychiatr Res. 2018;27:e1608. https://doi.org/10.1002/mpr.1608)
